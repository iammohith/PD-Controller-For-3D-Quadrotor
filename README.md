# PD Controller For 3D Quadrotor
This project involves implementing a Proportional-Derivative (PD) control system for a three-dimensional (3D) quadrotor. The objective is to stabilize the quadrotor's position ensuring smooth motion and maintaining the desired trajectory. The PD controller computes corrective actions based on the desired acceleration, position error (the difference between desired and current positions), velocity error (the difference between desired and current velocities), roll angle error (the difference between desired and current roll angles), pitch angle error (the difference between desired and current pitch angles), and yaw angle error (the difference between desired and current yaw angles), allowing for precise control.
